                The Digital Ram Mandir is an artistic digital twin of the
                Physical Ram Mandir, aimed at facilitating online darshans of
                the Bhavya Ram Mandir through the comfort of your home and
                convenience of your time and in the form of immersive and
                entertaining 1-minute stories. Not only that, the Digital Ram
                Mandir also offers patrons (including Pravasi Bhartiyas) a
                chance to stay connected to their roots, culture, and traditions
                (i.e., The Sanatan Dharma) through the power of our endless
                mythological characters.

                We are living in AI-driven attention deficit Economies wherein
                all Sanatanis of rising India and those living abroad want to
                stay connected to our spirituality but don’t have the time to
                read long manuscripts like Bhagavad Gita, Upanishads, and
                Puranas or attend physical religious offerings/Mandirs. We aim
                to satisfy the spiritual needs of this segment of people by
                offering them the Ram Mandir experience and many other
                experiential Mandir Darshans like char dham and 12 Jyotirlingas,
                aarti/ prasad offerings, and many such short-format religious
                and spiritual activities based on Upanishads, Bhagavad Gita,
                Mahabharata, Shiv Puran, Ram Charit Manas etc.. through our

                activities within the Digital Ram Mandir platform. We also
